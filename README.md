# University Football Player Injury Predictions

This project analyzes a football player dataset to predict the
likelihood of injury in the next season.
It uses a Kaggle dataset and trains a **Logistic Regression** model with
feature engineering for lifestyle and physical metrics.

## Features

-   Data preprocessing and feature engineering
-   Logistic Regression modeling pipeline
-   Model evaluation (classification report)
-   Correlation heatmap and injury‑rate visualizations

## How to Run

1.  Place the dataset in a folder named `kaggle_dataset/`

2.  Ensure Python 3.9+ and install dependencies:

    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Run the notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Output

The model achieves \~95% accuracy on the test set, showing strong
predictive capability.
